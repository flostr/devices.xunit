This is a fork of https://github.com/xunit/devices.xunit located at https://github.com/flostr/devices.xunit (Branch: master-filter-winrt-etc).

* Added functionality to specify a build-in filter, which can be set in RunnerApplication.Filter which will execute tests which include the filter in their full name (namespace + class name)
  Filter = "TakePhotoViewModelTests";
* Added RunnerApplication.OnTestsFinished event, which allows to specify what should happen after tests have been run. E.g. to deliver file output.

  
## WinRT

* There's a project file for WinRT: src\xunit.runner.devices

xunit.runner.win81 mostly uses UWP sources, but some files needed to be changed (these can be found in winrt directory). 


## General

* Those edits are marked between EDIT BEGIN and EDIT END, EDIT TODO marks code which still needs to be ported.
* XAML files have been heavily modifed.
* RunnerApplication has been extended to support OnTestsFinished, which will be called after tests have been finished.

These runners enable [xUnit.net](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/) tests to run on iOS and Android devices with [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) and on any UWP device. 

The xUnit.net Device Runners are a sub-project of xUnit.net under the [.NET Foundation](http://dotnetfoundation.org/). It is licensed under the [Apache 2 license](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0), which is approved by the OSI.

## How to get started

xUnit.net supports both .NET Standard and platform specific projects for iOS and Android. 
Unit tests for Xamarin have two main components, which may reside in the same assembly.

1.  Assemblies containing tests: install the latest xUnit 2.1 package. `Install-Package xUnit`
2.  App for running the tests on a device or simulator: install the xUnit for Devices runner package. `Install-Package xUnit.Runner.Devices`

The runner package adds a starting AppDelegate (for iOS), MainActivity (for Android) or MainPage.xaml (UWP) that you should use instead of
the one generated by the new project template. Unit tests in the application itself will be picked up automatically.
Referenced assemblies that contain tests need to be manually specified as described in the sample code.

## Platform support
- Xamarin.Android
- Xamarin.iOS
- UWP (Windows 10)

## This is a work-in-progress

Basic functionality works -- tests are discoverable and runnable. There is a lot of room for improvements in each
of the runner apps. Pull Requests are very welcome. One main requirement -- the runner assemblies should be self-contained; 
they should not pull in additional non-xunit libraries (except Xamarin.Forms).

### Todo
* Getting data back from runner to listening agent (remote)
* trait display/filters
* UI polish
